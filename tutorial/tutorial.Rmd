# Tutorial for the R package *treeplyr*
The purpose of *treeplyr* is to provide functions for matching a tree to data, and to manipulate that data using 
*dplyr*--all while maintaining a perfect match between the tree and the data. 

## I. Getting started
First we'll load some packages and generate some data to analyze. We're going to create a somewhat messy dataset
and use *treeplyr* to manipulate the data to fit our needs. 
``` {r }
require(treeplyr)
tree <- geiger::sim.bdtree(stop="taxa", n=50, seed=1)
dat <- data.frame(X1 = rnorm(50), X2 = rnorm(50), X3 = rnorm(50),
                  taxa=c(tree$tip.label[1:40], paste("s", 51:60, sep="")), 
                  D1=sample(c("Hello", "World"), 50, replace=TRUE), D2=rbinom(50,1,0.5), 
                  D3=0.3+rbinom(50, 4, c(0.1,0.1,0.5,0.3)), XNA1 = c(rep(NA, 10), rnorm(40)))
```

Let's check and see what the tree and data look like:
``` {r }
tree
head(dat)
```

Notice that the dataset we have created has a mix of trait types, with both discrete and continuous characters, some data with missing data,
and species names buried in the middle of the data matrix. The function *make.treeplyrdata* will search the data table for the column with 
the most matches to the tree, and automatically use this column for matching. It will also search the rownames. Either way, the command is
quite simple:
``` {r }
td <- make.treeplyrdata(tree, dat)
```

We can use summary to display information about our treeplyrdata object. 
``` {r }
summary(td)
```

We can also use indices directly on the treeplyrdata object, but note that these drop the tree:
``` {r }
td[[1]]
td[['X1']]
td[1:10,1:2]
```
For single brackets ('[]'), we can specify that we want to keep the tip labels:
``` {r }
td[1:10, 1, tip.label=TRUE]
```

## II. The Basics: Reorder, Select, Filter, & Mutate
### *reorder*
The treeplyrdata object itself is made up of a list of two elements *$phy* giving the tree and *$dat* providing in the data. One operation
that is relatively common is changing the ordering of the phylogeny. It's important to maintain a match between the tree and the data. 
``` {r }
td <- reorder(td, "postorder")
```

### *select*
We can use *dplyr* functions *select*, *filter* and *mutate* directly on the treeplyrdata object. The *select* function allows you to choose
which columns you want in the dataset. Any number of columns can be specified:
``` {r }
select(td, X1, D1)
select(td, 1:3)
select(td, 1, 4, 6)
```

### *filter*
We can also use the filter function allows us to select only those rows that meet a specific critierion. 
Multiple criteria can be used to limit the dataset even more. note that as the dataset is filtered, the tree
is automatically pruned to reflect the datasets represented.
``` {r }
filter(td, X1 > 0, D1=="Hello", is.na(XNA1)==FALSE)
filter(td, X1 + X2 > 0 & D1 == "Hello")
```

### *mutate*
The function *mutate* adds a new variable to the dataset. It may be a transformation of one or more existing variables.
For example, we may wish to log transform a variable, or average two or more variables.
``` {r }
mutate(td, Xall = (X1+X2+X3)/3, D1.binary = as.numeric(D1)-1)
```

## III. Programmatic use
You can use treeplyr programatically. For example:
``` {r }
mytraits <- c('X1', 'D1')
select(td, all_of(mytraits))
```

Similarly with filter and mutate:
``` {r }
# doesn't work yet
#criteria <- list("X1 > -1", "D1 == 'Hello'", "is.na(XNA1)==TRUE")

criteria <- list(
  quote(X1 > -1),
  quote(D1 == 'Hello'),
  quote(is.na(XNA1)==TRUE)
)
res<-td
for(i in 1:length(criteria)) {
  res<-filter(res, !!criteria[[i]])
}
res

```

*treeplyr* is mostly just a wrapper that passes on functions to *dplyr*, so most of the *dplyr* functionality is still there. 
All *treeplyr* does is make sure the tree and data stay matched through the course of your data manipulations. In other words,
you can still combine select, mutate, and filter with lots of other nice *dplyr* functions. Here are some examples:
``` {r }
select(td, starts_with("D"))
select(td, ends_with("1"))
select(td, matches("NA"))
select(td, contains("NA"))
select(td, which(sapply(td$dat, type_sum)=="int"))
```

Or dropping columns:
``` {r }
select(td, -matches("NA"))
select(td, -starts_with("X"))
```

## IV. Applying functions to treeplyrdata objects: treeply, treedply and tdapply
In many cases, the user may simply want to split apart the treeplyrdata object after matching and proceed in their analyses as normal. 
For example, we could measure phylogenetic signal in our trait *X1*:
``` {r }
phytools::phylosig(td$phy, getVector(td, X1))
```

### *treedply*
You can also run it directly on the treeplyrdata object using the function treedply:
``` {r }
treedply(td, phytools::phylosig(phy, getVector(td, X1), "K"))
```

        
Or multiple functions at once: 
``` {r }
treedply(td, list("K" = phytools::phylosig(phy, getVector(td, X1), "K"),
                  "lambda" = phytools::phylosig(phy, getVector(td, X1), "lambda"))
         )
```

### *forceFactor* & *forceNumeric*
We can also use the function *tdapply* which calls the *apply* function, but allows inclusion of the phylogeny. This can be useful for 
applying the same function over every column in our dataset. First though, we can use the functions *forceNumeric* and *forceFactor* to 
make sure that every column is of a type that can be analyzed by a function like *phenogram* or *phylosig*.  These functions to force 
the traits in the treeplyrdata object to be a factor or a continuous data, dropping those that cannot be converted. 
``` {r }
tdDiscrete <- forceFactor(td)
tdNumeric <- forceNumeric(td)
```

We can further filter out missing data in the trait *XNA1*.
``` {r }
tdNumeric <- filter(tdNumeric, !is.na(XNA1))
```

### *tdapply*
Then we can apply a function like *phenogram* to plot all the data:
``` {r }
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
tdapply(tdNumeric, 2, phytools::phenogram, tree=phy, spread.labels=FALSE, ftype="off")
```

Or you could fit all traits to a BM model and then pull out the sigsq parameter:
``` {r }
fitsBM <- tdapply(tdNumeric, 2, geiger::fitContinuous, phy=phy, model="BM")
sapply(fitsBM, function(x) x$opt$sigsq)
```

Perhaps more elegantly, you could use pipes to chain all of these operations together:
``` {r }
td %>% filter(., !is.na(XNA1)) %>% forceNumeric(.) %>% tdapply(., 2, phytools::phylosig, tree=phy)
```

You can manipulate the tree as well, using the function *treeply*, which is meant for simple operations on the tree alone that may 
or may not change the number of tips. For example, let's use the *geiger* function *rescale.phylo* to rescale the branches according 
to an OU model with an alpha value of 10. 
``` {r }
td.OU10 <- treeply(td, geiger::rescale, model="OU", 10)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(td$phy)
plot(td.OU10$phy)
```

Or we could drop tips from the tree (here we drop tips from 1 to 35).
``` {r }
treeply(td, drop.tip, c(1:35))
```

## V. Grouping
One of the cool features about *dplyr* is that it allows you to group variables and perform analyses independently 
on different groups with a single command. Currently, *treeplyr* only supports a single grouping variable at a time, 
but allows similar functionality. In this example, we will group taxa by the trait *D1*. You could easily imagine 
using this for a taxonomic level on the tree.
``` {r }
td.D1 <- group_by(td, D1)
```

### *summarize*/*summarise*
What good does this do? Well, we can use *summarize* to apply functions to specific groups.
``` {r }
summarize(td.D1, mean(X1), sd(X1), mean(X2), sd(X2))
```

But what about if our functions require a phylogeny? Well, we can do that too:
``` {r }
summarise(td.D1, ntips = length(phy$tip.label), 
            psig.X1 = phytools::phylosig(setNames(X1, phy$tip.label), tree=phy),
              psig.X2 = phytools::phylosig(setNames(X2, phy$tip.label), tree=phy))
```

Note both British and American spellings of *summarize/summarise* work.You might also want to do something like find 
the total branch length found in different groups of taxa:
``` {r }
summarise(td.D1, ntips = length(phy$tip.label), 
              totalTL = sum(phy$edge.length), varianceBL = var(phy$edge.length))
```

Or you could fit models of trait evolution to different groups in the tree (but note this is a dumb way
to build a summary table, as the fitContinuous function is run independently for each parameter).
``` {r }
summarise(td.D1, sigsq = geiger::fitContinuous(phy, setNames(X1, phy$tip.label))$opt$sigsq, 
                 root = geiger::fitContinuous(phy, setNames(X1, phy$tip.label))$opt$z0)
```

### *paint_clades*
We can also create a new variable that paints clades according to a particular set of nodes or branches (assuming a postordered tree). 
by using the function *paint_clades*. 
``` {r }
td.painted <- paint_clades(td, interactive=FALSE, type="nodes", ids=c(75, 66, 54, 48), plot=TRUE)
```

Or alternatively, you can specify which clades you want to group interactively. In the case below, the user selects 4 clades 
by clicking on the desired branches (i.e. when you run this script,YOU must click on 4 branches of your choosing 
to move forward!!): 
``` {r eval=FALSE}
td.painted <- paint_clades(td, 4, interactive=TRUE)
```

Now we group the phylogeny by the *clades* variable we just defined and calculate summary statistics for each group.
``` {r }
td.painted <- group_by(td.painted, clades)
summarise(td.painted, psig1 = phytools::phylosig(setNames(X1, phy$tip.label), tree=phy), 
          meanX1 = mean(X1), sdX1 = sd(X1), ntips =length(phy$tip.label))
```

Currently, the functions *treeply*, *treedply* and *tdapply* do not work with grouped data frames, and will analyze the 
entire dataset rather than specified subgroups. This will be added in future versions of *treeplyr*.
